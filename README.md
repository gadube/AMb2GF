# Automatic Markdown-based Blog Generator Framework (AMb2GF)

I use this to make a website/blog out of just markdown.

Check out my post on the framework [here](https://griffindube.com/blog/helloworld.html).

To build and deploy the site, simply run `make website`

Notes: 
- Requires pandoc and rsync.
- In order for rsync to work properly, you need to update the site location in `scripts/deploy.sh` to point to where you want your site copied.
